# MSNet

## Operating environment
The source code is compiled on the Windows 10 platform using Python 3.6. The dependencies include:
> pytorch: 1.7, framework </br>
> pandas: used for csv I/O </br>
> numpy: used for array operations </br>
> matplotlib: used to visualize training accuracy curves </br>
> opencv-python: used for remote sensing image I/O </br>
> scikit-learn: used for data preprocessing</br>

## Dataset
Since the original data was produced by Shi's research team[1] and will be published in the near future, we can only provide some sample data for the time being. 
We will update the links for all datasets when the official datasets are released.
